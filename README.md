# Book Predictor System using Cosine Similarity

## Project Description:
- This project involves building a book predictor system that utilizes the cosine similarity algorithm to provide book recommendations to users based on their past ratings.
- The system analyzes user ratings and identifies books that are similar in terms of the ratings they receive. 
- It preprocess the data by calculating the average rating and number of ratings for each book and filter out books with total ratings less than 200, and users who gave fewer than 50 reviews. 
- The code and results are documented in the accompanying Jupyter notebook.
